On the basis of earlier research, this code provides a Local Sensitivity Hashing
method and a Elementary Clustering method. 
The goal was to discover duplicates in a data collection of televisions 
from multiple web stores while lowering the computational load that would 
normally be associated with this task. 
As a result, the goal of this code is to evaluate the scalability of the 
implemented techniques on huge data sets.

The code is structured as follows. In the first section helper functions are defined,
then in the second section the algorithms are defined. In the third section 
a script is run to obtain results, and in the fourth and final section 
the graphs are plotted.

To use this script the follow json file is needed 'TVs-all-merged.json'.
